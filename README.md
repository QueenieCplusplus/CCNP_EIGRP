EIGRP 

* DUAL, Diffussing Update Algorithm 擴散演算法

The diffusing update algorithm (DUAL) is the algorithm used by Cisco's EIGRP routing protocol to ensure that a given route is recalculated globally whenever it might cause a routing loop. It was developed by J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves at SRI International.

* Routing Loop, 路由迴圈

A routing loop is a serious network problem which happens when a data packet is continually routed through the same routers over and over. The data packets continue to be routed within the network in an endless circle.
